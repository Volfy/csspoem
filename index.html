        <!---<span>the end of their journey - the depths they'd find</span>--->
        <div class="space-sente first-line"></div>

        <span class="marg-span">Our story begins on earth, many futures away.</span>
        <div class="space-sente"></div>

        <span class="marg-span">All civilizations are now dust. </span>
        <div class="space-sente"></div>

        <span class="marg-span">Nonetheless, humanity has persisted.</span>
        <div class="space-sente"></div>

        <span class="marg-span">Let's focus on one small group of adventurers:
        <span class="one a">The</span>ir time is spent scavenging the ruins of old
        cities, hacking together a town for themselves,
        passing time playing salvaged computer games,
        riding dune-buggies, and speculating endlessly
        about the meaning <span class="one c">of</span> extant diaries whose authors
        are now long dead.</span>
        <div class="space-sente"></div>

        <span class="marg-span">To survive in <span class="two w">the</span> harsh environment that greets
        them is not simple. Still, to this group of scavvies,
        for them, the <span class="one b">end</span> never feels nearby.</span>
        <div class="space-sente"></div>

        <span class="marg-span"><a href="">Llevashirym</a>, a city outside <span class="one d">their</span> general reach,
        had been heralded as one of the most prosperous
        and creative societies. The <span class="two x">depths</span> of information
        referred to by authors that'd lived nearby, was sure
        to be useful - and more importantly, quench their
        endless curiosities about the world before them.</span>
        <div class="space-sente"></div>
        
        <span class="marg-span">Before they'd even be able to visit, <span class="two y">they'd</span> have much
        to prepare. The resources necessary for a <span class="one e">journey</span>
        like this, would require many days of work.</span>
        <div class="space-sente"></div>

        <span class="marg-span">However, the scavvies do not give up, and they <span class="two z">find</span>
        hope in all endeavours. The rough directions and 
        vague descriptions could only help so far, their eyes
        open to anything that could be.</span>
