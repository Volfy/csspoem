            <p>Our story begins on the Earth, many futures away. 
        <br>Mass desertification has turned all but a few civilizations to dust, but humanity has persisted nonetheless. 
        <br>A group of adventurers - they call themselves scavvies -  spend their free time hiking old cities, scavenging for parts to hack together all kinds of things. 
        <br>Their finds help build up shelter and is essential to their survival in this new world, but they are not desperate. 
        <br>In their little DIY town, they'd pass the time by playing salvaged computer games, riding dune-buggies, and speculating about the lives of authors whose extant diaries had lined their bookshelves. 

        <br> The scavvies have covered most of the land around them. 
        <br>In the past few months, they've been gearing up for a long journey - they want to explore the land of Llevashirym (ipa / pronunciation), whose residents led a prosperous and creative civilization. 
        <br>At least, if the old descriptions by neighbouring towns is believed. <br>Scarce bits of the language - llevu - crop up often in longer writings dedicated to examining the depths of lost ideas. 
        <br>Our adventurers hope they can learn enough about the culture to piece together more context clues - solving history like a puzzle, for the satisfaction of their curiosity. 
        <br>I mean, what else was there to do?
            
        <br>The journey took many days, and tested their physical capacities. 
        <br>A few wished to return, but the group had to stay together if they wanted to have any chance at getting there, and once there, at gathering enough objects. 
        <br>With no map, and only rough directions to lead them, little could signify the end of their journey, or, in other words, the limits of Llevashirym. 
        <br>If they could even find it. </p>-->
